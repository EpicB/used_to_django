in the 'url.py' that is in the app you define the route of which you want to load the file in 

after that in the 'view.py' file you do the following 
def start(request):
    return render(request,'index.html')

you use the render method which takes the request and the file name

        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR,'folderName'], <<<< YOU CHANGE THE FOLLOWING 
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
