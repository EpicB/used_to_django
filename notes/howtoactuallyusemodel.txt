in "models.py" you use the modele and apply it to the class and 
in the attributes you use models.CharField(max_length=100)
to define that model


from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class feature(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    details = models.CharField(max_length=500)

in "settings.py" in the installed_apps include your app name

'appname'

now you migrate the changes to the manage.py file
using this command

python3 manage.py makemigrations 

this will create the model 

this is a 2 step method you need to migrate it intot he data base

python3 manage.py migrate

this needs to be done everytime you change the models.py file -- -- -- --

in the 'admin.py' file you can now register your models as so 

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import feature
# Register your models here.

admin.site.register(feature) ---- most important line

to create a super user 
python3 manage.py createsuperuser


in the admin panel you can insert data to the models 

now in the views.py you can use the database as follows 

def model(request):
    features = feature.objects.all() -- most important line
    return render(request,'modelsmaster.html',{"features":features})


dont forget to import models 
from . import models
