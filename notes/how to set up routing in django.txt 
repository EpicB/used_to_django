how to start the app 

python3 manage.py startapp "name of the app"

how to startup the django server 

python3 manage.py runserver 


how to configure the routing 

once you create the app it generates a couple of files 

first thing create a "urls.py" that is in the app folder 

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = {
    path('',views.index,name='index'),
    path('downloads',views.potato,name='potato')
}

path function arguements

1 the route empty '' means the home page 
2 the function from the views file that returns the http request to render the html
3 a variable idk what it is yet nor i used but its advised to give it the same value as the function
name 

make sure you type urlpatterns this way therefor it doesnt give an error 



in the "views.py" you can define functions that returns the httprepsonse for the meant route

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1>Potato</h1>')
def potato(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1>hahah you are in potato land</h1>')


lastly for the project folder in the "url.py" file 

in the urlpatterns list you can add a new path that is taken from the 'urls.py' file in the app
folder 

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('myapp.urls')) most important line 
]
